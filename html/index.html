                Software development is a young profession, and we are still learning the
                techniques and building the tools to do it effectively. I've been involved
                in this activity for over 
                three decades and in the last two I've been
                writing on this website about patterns and 
                practices that make it easier to build useful
                software. The site began as a place to put 
                my own writing, but I also use it to publish articles by my colleagues.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2000, I joined <a class="highlight" href="https://thoughtworks.com">Thoughtworks</a>, where my role
                is to learn about the techniques that we've 
                learned to deliver software
                for our clients, and pass these techniques on to the wider software 
                industry. As this site has developed into a respected platform on software
                development, I've edited and published articles by my colleagues, both Thoughtworkers
                and others, to help useful 
                writing reach a wider audience.

                <h1>A website on building software effectively</h1>
                <p>If there's a theme that runs through my work and writing on this site,
                    it's the interplay between the shift towards agile thinking and the
                    technical patterns and practices that make agile software development
                    practical. While specifics of technology change rapidly in our
                    profession, fundamental practices and patterns are more stable. So
                    writing about these allows me to have articles on this site that are
                    several years old but still as relevant as when they were written.
                </p>
                <p>As software becomes more critical to modern business, software needs to
                    be able to react quickly to changes, allowing new features to be be
                    conceived, developed and put into production rapidly. The techniques of
                    <a class="highlight" href="/agile.html">agile software development</a> began in the 1990s
                    and became steadily more popular in the last decade. They focus on a
                    flexible approach to planning, which allows software products to change
                    direction as the users' needs change and as product managers learn more
                    about how to make their users effective. While widely accepted now, agile
                    approaches are not easy, requiring significant skills for a team, but more
                    importantly a culture of open collaboration both within the team and with a
                    team's partners.
                </p>
                <p>This need to respond fluently to changes has an important impact upon
                    the <a class="highlight" href="/architecture">architecture</a> of a software system. The
                    software needs to be built in such a way that it is able to adapt to
                    unexpected changes in features. One of the most important ways to do this
                    is to write clear code, making it easy to understand what the program
                    is supposed to do. This code should be divided into modules which allow
                    developers to understand only the parts of the system they need to make a
                    change. This production code should be supported with automated tests that
                    can detect any errors made when making a change while providing examples
                    of how internal structures are used. Large and complex software efforts
                    may find the <a class="highlight" href="/microservices">microservices</a> architectural style
                    helps teams deploy software with less entangling dependencies.
                </p>
                <p>Creating software that has a good architecture isn't something that can
                    be done first time. Like good prose, it needs regular revisions as
                    programmers learn more about what the product needs to do and how best to
                    design the product to achieve its goals. <a class="highlight" href="https://refactoring.com">Refactoring</a> is an essential technique to allow a
                    program to be changed safely. It consists of making small changes that
                    don't alter the observable behavior of the software. By combining lots of
                    small changes, developers can revise the software's structure supporting
                    significant modifications that weren't planned when the system was first
                    conceived.
                </p>
                <p>Software that runs only on a developer's machine isn't providing
                    value to the customers of the software. Traditionally releasing software
                    has been a long and complicated process, one that hinders the need to
                    evolve software quickly. <a class="highlight" href="/delivery.html">Continuous Delivery</a> uses
                    automation and collaborative workflows to remove this bottleneck,
                    allowing teams to release software as often as the customers demand. 
                    For Continuous Delivery to be possible, we need to build in a solid
                    foundation of <a class="highlight" href="/testing">Testing</a>, with a range of
                    automated tests that can give us confidence that our changes haven't
                    introduced any bugs. This leads us to integrate testing into
                    programming, which can act to improve our architecture.

                        across a large enterprise, the role of NoSQL databases, and the
                        broader issues of coping with data that is both Big and Messy.

                    <p> Most of the talk about the impact of GenAI on software development is
                           about its ability to write (messy) code. But many of us think it's going
                           to be much more useful to help us <i>understand</i> existing messy code,
                           as part of a modernization effort. My colleagues <b class="author">Alessio

                           including building an internal tool to help explore the possibilities.
                           The tool uses an LLM to enhance a knowledge graph based on the AST of the
                           code base. It also uses an LLM to help users query this knowledge graph.

                    <p>Cycle Time is a measure of how long it takes to get a new feature in a
                      software system from idea to running in production. In Agile circles, we try
                      to minimize cycle time. We do this by defining and implementing very small
                      features and minimizing delays in the development process. Although the rough
                      notion of cycle time, and the importance of reducing it, is common, there is a
                      lot of variations on how cycle time is measured.</p>

                    <p>Two decades ago, I posted that I found that the strangler fig plant was an interesting metaphor for the gradual replacement of a legacy system. I didn’t refer to the metaphor since, but meanwhile it grew a life of its own. Other people increasingly referred to the strangler fig approach to modernization, and traffic to that post steadily increased: currently it gets about 5000 page views a month, one of the more popular pages on this site. So I decided I needed to <a href="/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html">update that page</a>, and have rewritten it, focusing on the core activities we need to do to make a success of such a venture.</p>

                           about generating code. But it may have a more useful role in helping us
                           understand existing code. This is especially true for older codebases
                           that are getting hard to maintain (“legacy”) or to improve onboarding in
                           teams that have a lot of fluctuation.</p>
