                Software development is a young profession, and we are still learning the <br>
                techniques and building the tools to do it effectively. I've been involved
                in this <br> activity for over three decades and in the last two I've beenwriting 
                on this website <br>about patterns and practices that make it easier to build useful
                software. The site <br> began as a place to put my own writing, but I also use it to 
                publish articles by my <br>colleagues.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2000, I joined <a class="highlight" href="https://thoughtworks.com">Thoughtworks</a>, where my role
                is to learn about the techniques <br>that we've learned to deliver software
                for our clients, and pass these techniques on <br>to the wider software 
                industry. As this site has developed into a respected platform <br> on software
                development, I've edited and published articles by my colleagues, both <br>Thoughtworkers
                and others, to help useful writing reach a wider audience.

                <h1>A website on building software effectively</h1>
                <p>If there's a theme that runs through my work
                    and writing on this site, it's the interplay
                    between the shift towards agile thinking and the
                    technical patterns and practices that make agile
                    software development practical. While specifics
                    of technology change rapidly in our profession,
                    fundamental practices and patterns are more
                    stable. So writing about these allows me to
                    have articles on this site that are several
                    years old but still as relevant as when they
                    were written.
                </p>
                <p>As software becomes more critical to modern business, software needs to
                    be able to react quickly to changes, allowing new features to be be
                    conceived, developed and put into production rapidly. The techniques of
                    <a class="" href="">agile software development</a> began in the 1990s
                    and became steadily more popular in the last decade. They focus on a
                    flexible approach to planning, which allows software products to change
                    direction as the users' needs change and as product managers learn more
                    about how to make their users effective. While widely accepted now, agile
                    approaches are not easy, requiring significant skills for a team, but more
                    importantly a culture of open collaboration both within the team and with a
                    team's partners.</p>
                <p> This need to respond fluently to changes has an important impact upon
                    the <a class="highlight" href="">architecture</a> of a software system. The
                    software needs to be built in such a way that it is able to adapt to
                    unexpected changes in features. One of the most important ways to do this
                    is to write clear code, making it easy to understand what the program
                    is supposed to do. This code should be divided into modules which allow
                    developers to understand only the parts of the system they need to make a
                    change. This production code should be supported with automated tests that
                    can detect any errors made when making a change while providing examples
                    of how internal structures are used. Large and complex software efforts
                    may find the <a class="highlight" href="">microservices</a> architectural style
                    helps teams deploy software with less entangling dependencies.
                </p>
                <p> Creating software that has a good architecture isn't something that can
                    be done first time. Like good prose, it needs regular revisions as
                    programmers learn more about what the product needs to do and how best to
                    design the product to achieve its goals. <a class="highlight" href="">Refactoring</a> is an essential technique to allow a
                    program to be changed safely. It consists of making small changes that
                    don't alter the observable behavior of the software. By combining lots of
                    small changes, developers can revise the software's structure supporting
                    significant modifications that weren't planned when the system was first
                    conceived.
                </p>
                <p> Software that runs only on a developer's machine isn't providing
                    value to the customers of the software. Traditionally releasing software
                    has been a long and complicated process, one that hinders the need to
                    evolve software quickly. <a class="highlight" href="">Continuous Delivery</a> uses
                    automation and collaborative workflows to remove this bottleneck,
                    allowing teams to release software as often as the customers demand. 
                    For Continuous Delivery to be possible, we need to build in a solid
                    foundation of <a class="highlight" href="">Testing</a>, with a range of
                    automated tests that can give us confidence that our changes haven't
                    introduced any bugs. This leads us to integrate testing into
                    programming, which can act to improve our architecture.

                        There are many kinds of

                        the kind I'm most interested in
                        is data about data, or metadata.
                        This includes data about the structure
                        of data, data about the meaning of data,
                        and data about the usage of data. I'm
                        particularly interested in how metadata
                        can be used to improve the quality of
                        data, and how it can be used to improve
                        the efficiency of <a href="" class="type">data management</a>. I'm
                        also interested in how metadata can be
                        used to improve the usability of data,
                        and how it can be used to improve the 
                        security of data. I'm currently working
                        with data from the web, and from Mongo.

                           A common problem in computer science
                           is that software systems are often too
                           complex, and too difficult to understand.
                           One way to address this problem is to use
                           <a href="" class="type">domain-specific languages</a>(DSLs), which are
                           languages that are designed to solve particular
                           problems, or to address particular domains within
                           a larger language.

                <p>Cycle Time is a measure of how long it takes to get a new feature in a
                    software system from idea to running in production. In Agile circles, we try
                    to minimize cycle time. We do this by defining and implementing very small
                    features and minimizing delays in the development process. Although the rough
                    notion of cycle time, and the importance of reducing it, is common, there is a
                    lot of variations on how cycle time is measured.</p>

                <h2>Rewriting Strangler Fig</h2>
                                
                <p class="date">Thu 22 Aug 2024 11:51 </p>
                <p>Two decades ago, I posted that I found
                that the strangler fig plant was an interesting
                metaphor for the gradual replacement of a
                legacy system. I didn’t refer to the metaphor since,
                but meanwhile it grew a life of its own. Other
                people increasingly referred to the strangler
                fig approach to modernization, and traffic to
                that post steadily increased: currently it gets
                about 5000 page views a month, one of the more 
                popular pages on this site. So I decided I needed
                to <a href="">update that page</a>, and have
                rewritten it, focusing on the core activities we
                need to do to make a success of such a venture.

                <h2>Onboarding to a “legacy” codebase with the help of AI</h2>

                <p>Much of the attention to generative AI in software development is
                about generating code. But it may have a more useful role in helping us
                understand existing code. This is especially true for older codebases
                that are getting hard to maintain (“legacy”) or to improve onboarding in
                teams that have a lot of fluctuation.</p>
